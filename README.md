## Statement of Tool Integration
This portfolio represents a collaborative workflow between human intent and artificial intelligence. In the spirit of the course's focus on Systems Thinking and modern "Vibe Coding" methodologies:
* Conceptual Framework: All systems analysis, coffee shop breakdowns, and takeaways are original work developed by me (and my team where applicable).
* Code & Visualization: AI tools (including Gemini and specialized code models) were utilized to assist in generating boilerplate code, debugging Rust/Python logic, and rendering complex animations (e.g., Manim scripts).
* Documentation: Technical writing and markdown structure have been refined using AI for clarity and organization.
*This approach is intentionally used to explore the systemic interaction between human creativity and automated execution.*
