# Coffee Shop System

## Components:
- Barista
- Customer
- POS System
- Ingredients (Coffee, Milk, Syrups, etc.)
- Tools (Espresso Machine, Grinder, etc.)
- Inventory (Cups, Napkins, etc.)
- Coffee Shop (Location, Hours, Ambiance, Interior Design, etc.)

In systems thinking, a coffee shop is a complex web of interconnected parts where resources accumulate and move based on various pressures. Here is the completed breakdown of those stocks, flows, and loops.

## Stocks and Flows

**Stocks** are the accumulations of resources in the system at any given time. **Flows** are the actions that increase (inflow) or decrease (outflow) those stocks.

### Stocks:

* **Inventory Levels:** The physical amount of coffee beans, milk cartons, and syrups currently behind the counter.
* **Order Queue:** The number of pending drink orders waiting to be fulfilled by the barista.
* **Cash Reserves:** The total amount of money in the POS system or bank account.
* **Customer Density:** The number of people currently inside the shop's physical space.

### Flows:

* **Procurement (Inflow):** Buying more beans and supplies from wholesalers to increase inventory.
* **Sales/Consumption (Outflow):** Baristas using ingredients to make drinks, thereby decreasing inventory.
* **Order Placement (Inflow):** Customers paying for drinks, which increases the order queue and cash reserves.
* **Order Fulfillment (Outflow):** Completing and handing off drinks, which decreases the order queue.

## Feedback Loops

### Positive Feedback Loop (Reinforcing):

A reinforcing loop where a change in one direction leads to even more change in that same direction.

* **The "Word of Mouth" Loop:**
1. **High Ambiance/Quality** leads to increased **Customer Satisfaction**.
2. Satisfied customers leave **Positive Reviews** or tell friends.
3. This increases **Customer Inflow** (New Customers).
4. Higher revenue allows for better **Ambiance/Quality** (better beans, nicer decor), repeating the cycle and leading to exponential growth.



### Negative Feedback Loop (Balancing):

A balancing loop that seeks to keep the system in a state of equilibrium or stability.

* **The "Wait Time" Regulator:**
1. A high **Order Queue** leads to long **Wait Times**.
2. Long wait times act as a "bottleneck" that discourages new customers from entering the shop or joining the line (**Decreased Inflow**).
3. As fewer people join the line, the Barista is able to work through the existing queue.
4. The **Order Queue** eventually shrinks back to a manageable level, stabilizing the system.
