# Week 1 Mindmap 01-12-2026
This week we established the basis for Systems Thinking and how to think, design and make decisions with AI. We focused on how to make AI a thought partner understand it as a component of a larger system.

## Reflection:
1. Systems are everywhere and they are complex:
- The more you think about systems, the more you see them in every aspect of life. From coffee shops, the airport, to restaurants, to schools, to hospitals, to governments, to economies, to environments, to the universe. 
- Often times the prossess of braking down a system into its components can be insightful. Leading to a better understanding of the system as a whole.

2. Drawing out systems and their components can be insightful:
- This can help us understand the system as a whole and how different components interact with each other.
- It can also help us identify potential issues and opportunities for improvement.

3. Human judgement is essential when working with AI:
- While a valueble tool and thought partner, it is not a replacement for human judgement.
- Centain problems should not be delegated to AI, as it is not able to make ethical decisions or understand the context of a problem.
